> [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator


## Getting Started

### Features

JPGCode Generator allows you to easily create projects from scratch using the following technologies:

- Yeoman
- Grunt
- Sass
- Compass
- Bower

You will have a nice structure to start working very quickly using latest web standards.

Enjoy!

### What is Yeoman?

Trick question. It's not a thing. It's this guy:

Basically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```bash
$ npm install -g yo
```

### Yeoman Generators

Yeoman travels light. He didn't pack any generators when he moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, such as a Backbone application or even a Chrome extension.

### Installation

To install generator-jpgcode from npm, you need to clone or download the generator and run:

```bash
$ npm link
```

This should install the generator in your machine.

Finally, initiate the generator:

```bash
$ yo jpgcode
```
